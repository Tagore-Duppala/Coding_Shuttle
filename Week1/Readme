This shows the creation of Beans and Dependancy injection

The order of Hierarchy is as follows:

                                                                    ChocolateFrosting
                                           Frosting interface ---> 
                                                                    StrawberryFrosting
SpringBoot application ---> CakeBaker --->                   
                                                                    ChocolateSyrup
                                            Syrup interface  --->   
                                                                    StrawberrySyrup



SpringBoot application is main entry point, It sets up environment and scans through all the annotations and then starts executing dependency injection

pom.xml --> Contains required dependencies, Adds the versions as well, If needed we can change them
AutoConfiguration (External Library) --> Configures the required configurations to default values, If required we can change them.
Maven ---> Build automation tool which manages the complete project, Can convert whole project into Jar file required for deployment.
